## Process

This is a small project so the process is pretty [straightforward](https://xkcd.com/1597/).

- [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) :arrow_upper_right:
- Make some changes :construction:
- Open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) :white_check_mark:

TravisCI will take care of running tests (but add your own!), running [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) and [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint), and calling Coveralls to ensure code coverage. I'll review the PR and get your contributions added to the repo!

Happy coding! :palm_tree:
