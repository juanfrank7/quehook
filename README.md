## Introduction :beers:

**WatchMyRepo** is an application to monitor open source repository community activity and provide data-driven insights and visibility into subscribed projects. Project maintainers can subscribe their repositories to the application which will actively collect data and make it available for third parties like interested contributors or financial supporters.

## Usage :octocat:

> The app is currently under active development but once the MVP is ready, this section will be updated :construction:

## Roadmap :round_pushpin:

A simple MVP is the initial target for the launch but expanded functionality and a smoother application interface will be rolled out in the immediately subsequent versions; at this point, I'm only expecting one major "pivot" from the MVP in the second version.

Below is the roadmap:

- [ ] **version 1 ("MVP")**
  - [ ] _pull-based data retrieval_ - application makes periodic data fetch calls
  - [ ] _general summary data collection_ - basic datapoints are collected from subscribed repositories
  - [ ] _manual watcher signup_ - third-parties are manually added to the data retrieval whitelist
  - [ ] _summary data email subscription_ - I'll send out periodic emails to anyone interested (a link will be included in this documentation to subscribe to)
- [ ] **version 2 ("pivot")**
  - [ ] _watcher signup functionality_ - third-party watchers can subscribe themselves to the whitelist
  - [ ] _expanded datapoint collection_ - more basic datapoints are added to the initial list
  - [ ] _original data science_ - additional information inferred/projected from collected datapoints
- [ ] **version 3 ("deprecation")**
  - [ ] _paid repo "bump" functionality_ - maintainers can pay to have their projects "bumped" in visibility
  - [ ] _re-brand project name_ - possibly rename this project to "Comana" ("community analytics")
